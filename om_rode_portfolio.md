## About Me
I'm a Computer Vision Engineer at Quantic Tech Analysis, with hands-on experience in deploying scalable CV/ML solutions in production. I bring a unique edge through my background in robotics, embedded systems, and real-time perception.

Previously, I was a Robotics Intern at Solar Industries India Ltd., and led the Formula Student team *Ashwariders* as Team Captain, focusing on electronics and data acquisition.

My core strengths lie in designing and deploying ML pipelines, working with RTSP-based systems, YOLO-based custom training, CUDA optimization, and multi-threaded applications. I'm currently focused on building robust, production-ready AI systems for real-world automation.

## Skills & Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, C++, Bash  
**Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorRT, FastAPI, OpenCV, ROS2  
**DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Vercel, AWS  
**Tools:** Kafka, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana  
**Other:** Embedded C, Multithreading, Jetson Deployment, Model Quantization, Homography  

## Projects

### RTSP YOLO API
A scalable API pipeline to consume RTSP streams and run YOLO-based detection with multi-threaded performance. Includes recording functionality for person-specific clips with pre/post buffers.  
**Tech:** PyTorch, OpenCV, Flask/FastAPI, ffmpeg  
[GitHub](https://github.com/omrode1/rtsp_yolo_api)

### LPG Cylinder Bottom Classification
Custom-trained EfficientNet-B5 model to classify LPG cylinder conditions into four classes: 'good', 'ring bent', 'ring cut', and 'rust'. Optimized for real-time edge inference using ONNX and TensorRT.  
**Deployed on Jetson Xavier**

### BEV Perception Pipeline
Worked on transforming camera feeds into Bird’s Eye View projections using homography-based mapping and stitching, integrated into real-time monitoring pipelines.  
**Application:** Industrial automation and safety

### Sub-50g Drone Flight Controller
Designed a custom lightweight flight controller for a micro drone.  
**Focus:** Hardware design, embedded C, IMU integration

### AI Incident Response Dashboard (In Progress)
End-to-end system for real-time log ingestion, AI anomaly detection, and automated system recovery visualized via a React-D3 dashboard.  
**Stack:** Kafka, FastAPI, PyTorch, React, Docker, AWS
